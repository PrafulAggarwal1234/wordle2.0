### Created an engaging and interactive web application using React.js to develop the popular word-guessing game, Wordle. Designed and implemented a dynamic and visually appealing user interface with real-time scoring and a captivating game board. Utilized the DATAMUSE API to fetch a selection of words, dynamically generating a random word for each game session. Developed a custom algorithm to change the color of each letter based on the game rules, enhancing the visual interactivity using CSS keyframes. Implemented a validation algorithm using MERRIAM-WEBSTERâ€™S API to verify if a guessed word is a valid English word.
